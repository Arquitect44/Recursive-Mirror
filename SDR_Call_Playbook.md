# **SDR COLD CALL PLAYBOOK - EVO SECURITY**

## **ðŸŽ¯ THE OPENER**
"Hey [Name]? Yeah hey, it's Marquise with Evo Security. I know the last thing you want is a cold call. I'm reaching out because cyber insurers are requiring PAM by Q2, but most MSPs are losing money managing passwords and elevation requests. Curious - are you billing for identity management yet, or still eating those costs?"

## **ðŸ”€ RESPONSE PATHS**

### **Path A: "We use [tool/process]"**
â†’ "Got it - and when techs need emergency access at 2 AM, how does that work with [their tool]?"

### **Path B: "We're good/Not interested"**  
â†’ "Totally understand. Quick question though - when was the last time someone called your help desk pretending to be the CEO needing a password reset?"

### **Path C: Shows Interest**
â†’ "Before I dive into how we help - what's the biggest identity headache for your team right now? Password resets? Compliance? Something else?"

---

## **ðŸŽ£ DISCOVERY QUESTIONS**

### **Pain Points:**
- "How many password reset tickets does your team handle weekly?"
- "What happens when a client's employee calls at midnight locked out?"
- "How do you currently verify someone's identity over the phone?"
- "Ever had a client fail a security audit because of shared credentials?"

### **Current State:**
- "Walk me through what happens when a tech needs admin access"
- "How many different tools are you using for passwords, MFA, and access?"
- "What's your process when onboarding a new client?"

### **Future Vision:**
- "In a perfect world, how would identity management work for your MSP?"
- "If you could eliminate one identity headache, what would it be?"

## **ðŸ’¬ 30-SECOND PITCH** (Only after discovery!)
"So we built a platform specifically for MSPs that handles all of that in one place - elevation, verification, MFA, everything multi-tenant. Most importantly, it turns identity from a cost center into a profit center. Would it make sense to show you how [MSP similar to them] is handling [their specific pain]?"

---

## **ðŸŽ¯ CLOSING OPTIONS**

### **Soft Close:**
"Look, I know you're swamped. How about I send you a 3-minute video showing exactly how we solve [their specific issue], and if it resonates, we can dig deeper?"

### **Meeting Close:**
"Based on what you shared about [pain], I think I can show you something valuable. Do you have 15 minutes Thursday or Friday to see how we're helping MSPs like yours?"

---

## **ðŸš« OBJECTION HANDLES**

**"Send me info"**
â†’ "Happy to - but to make sure I send relevant stuff, what specific identity challenge is top priority right now?"

**"We're under contract"**
â†’ "Makes sense. When's renewal? Most MSPs evaluate options 90 days out to negotiate better."

**"Too expensive"**
â†’ "I hear you. Quick question - what's the hourly cost when your senior tech handles password resets instead of billable work?"

**"No budget"**
â†’ "I get it. What if I could show you how to turn identity management into a revenue stream instead of a cost center? Most MSPs add $3-5 per user."

**"Not a priority"**
â†’ "Understood. Just curious - when's your next cyber insurance renewal? They're starting to require PAM documentation."

## **ðŸŽ¯ POWER QUESTIONS**

### **Revenue Focused:**
- "Are you currently billing clients for identity management, or is that bundled into your base fee?"
- "What would an extra $3-5 per user per month mean for your MSP?"

### **Efficiency Focused:**
- "How much time does your team waste on password resets weekly?"
- "What could your techs accomplish with 30% more productive time?"

### **Risk Focused:**
- "Ever worry about a social engineering attack through your help desk?"
- "What's your plan when cyber insurance requires PAM next renewal?"
